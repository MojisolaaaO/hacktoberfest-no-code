# Welcome to Mautic!
This is a repo for people who contribute no-code tasks to log their activity, so that their contributions can be recognised, and for no-code tasks to be raised as issues.

You'll find a file for each year, which contains everything you need to know about contributing, and the activity log which you can edit to get your contributions recognised.
